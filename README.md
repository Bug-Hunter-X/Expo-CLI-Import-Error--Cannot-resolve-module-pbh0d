# Expo CLI Import Error: Cannot resolve module

This repository demonstrates a common error in Expo CLI projects where the system fails to resolve a module during the import process. This typically happens because of typos in the import paths, missing module installations, or incorrect project configuration. 

The `bug.js` file showcases the erroneous code, and the `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  This example uses a simple component import, but the principle applies to any module import in Expo.
