This error typically occurs when you try to import a module that doesn't exist or is not accessible within your Expo project.  It often arises from typos in import paths, incorrect module installations, or issues with the project's configuration.

**Example of a problematic import statement:**
```javascript
import { SomeComponent } from './components/SomeComponent'; //If SomeComponent.js doesn't exist or the path is wrong
```

**Another common cause** is trying to use a module that hasn't been properly installed using `expo install`.
