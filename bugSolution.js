To fix this, you need to:

1. **Verify the import path:** Double-check that the file path you've specified in the `import` statement is accurate and that the file exists. Correct any typos. 

2. **Install the module:** If you're importing a third-party library, make sure that you've installed it correctly using `expo install <module_name>`. 

3. **Check project structure:** Ensure your project's file structure matches the import paths.  A visual check or using your IDE's file explorer helps.

4. **Clean and rebuild:**  Sometimes, cached files can cause issues. Try running `expo start --clear` to clear the cache and restart the Expo server. If this doesn't work try `expo prebuild` followed by `expo start`.

**Example of corrected import statement:**
```javascript
import { SomeComponent } from './components/SomeComponent'; // Assuming the file exists at this path
```

**If the issue persists after checking these points, you'll need to provide more details about your project structure, the error message, and the code in question.**
